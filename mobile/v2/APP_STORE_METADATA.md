## App Description

### Short Description (Promotional Text - 170 chars)
```
Secure, ephemeral two-person chat with end-to-end encryption. Create a token, share it, and connect privately with video calls. No accounts, no message storage.
```

### Full Description (4000 chars max)
```
ChatOrbit lets you create private, time-limited chat sessions with just one other person. Perfect for confidential conversations that don't need to live forever.

HOW IT WORKS
1. Generate a unique session token with your preferred time limit
2. Share the token with your contact through any channel
3. Once both devices connect, your secure session begins
4. When time runs out, the session closes automatically

KEY FEATURES

🔐 End-to-End Encryption
All messages are encrypted using AES-256-GCM. Encryption keys are derived from your session token and never leave your device.

⏱️ Time-Limited Sessions
Choose how long your session lasts - from 5 minutes to 12 hours. The countdown starts when both participants join.

📹 Peer-to-Peer Video
Start a video call directly with your chat partner. Video streams flow directly between devices using WebRTC - no server in the middle.

🚫 No Accounts Required
No email, no phone number, no registration. Just generate a token and start chatting.

💨 Ephemeral by Design
Messages exist only in your device's memory. When the session ends, everything is gone. No server-side archives.

🌍 Multilingual
Available in English and Slovak.

PERFECT FOR
• Quick private conversations
• Sharing sensitive information temporarily
• Video calls without account signup
• Time-boxed discussions that auto-expire

PRIVACY FIRST
ChatOrbit doesn't store your messages on any server. Your conversations stay between you and your chat partner. We can't read your messages because we never have them.

Download ChatOrbit and experience truly private communication.
